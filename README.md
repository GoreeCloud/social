# GoreeCloud Social

GoreeCloud Social is the in-development, first-party GoreeCloud social platform for public and private social publishing, short-form video, photos, communities, groups, social relationships, reactions, reposts, discovery, and supported GoreeCloud integrations.

## Current status

**Development source — not Stable, not production-ready, and not yet a public social service.**

The native Development foundation establishes:

- a Django 5.2 development server and read-only source-status interface;
- liveness, database-aware readiness, and bounded product-status endpoints;
- GoreeCloud Social profile metadata that references an external GoreeCloud Identity subject instead of creating a second password or authentication store;
- groups and communities with membership and role primitives;
- directional follows, bilateral blocks, viewer-selected mutes, directional restrict groundwork, owner-curated List/Circle collections, explicit space invitations and join requests, and ordered space rules as internal Social domain records;
- posts, explicit reply-parent relationships, media references, single-choice poll groundwork, private bookmarks, reactions, reposts, post/profile reports, space bans, moderation cases/actions, and appeals;
- audience-aware post visibility for public, followers, mutual relationships, spaces, and private-to-self content;
- ordinary read visibility that enforces bilateral blocks, viewer-selected mutes, and active non-expired space bans for protected space-audience reads;
- internal Following and Chronological feed read models that reuse the same visibility and relationship-safety boundary;
- dev.7 Community Governance services for public/private/invite-only community discovery, community-scoped post/rule reads, explicit moderator/admin/owner capability decisions, and protected internal join-request, membership, and moderation queues;
- a responsive Glaze-oriented development shell for Home, Discover, Video, Communities, and Profile surfaces without claiming Glaze UI acceptance;
- repository documentation, tests, CI, and a Platform Contract v0.4 declaration covering all nine Integral Platform Systems while truthfully recording unfinished integrations.

The collection, invitation, join-request, rule, reply, bookmark, poll, feed, restriction, reporting, ban, case/action, appeal, and dev.7 Community Governance foundations are internal Development domain/query capabilities only. dev.7 distinguishes Social-local role eligibility from authoritative actor identity and fails closed unless an explicitly authoritative actor subject matches the Social profile Identity subject. It does not authenticate sessions, expose public mutation or personalized-feed endpoints, or establish accepted Identity-backed authorization, moderation authority, anti-spam, rate controls, impersonation handling, malicious-link/file/media protection, age-eligibility controls, recommendation ranking, production feed delivery, or client synchronization.

This source does **not** yet provide production authentication, public social or moderation write APIs, public personalized feed APIs, production media upload/transcoding, production abuse detection, Wardveil-integrated scanning/protection, Privacy Shield moderation-data acceptance, recommendation ranking, notifications, live streaming, mature moderation operations, production storage, mobile applications, production deployment, or accepted integrations with GoreeCloud Identity, Privacy Shield, Wardveil Security, Everkeep, GoreeCloud Mesh, GoreeCloud Manager, GoreeCloud Policy, GoreeCloud Observability, or Glaze UI.

## Development setup

Requirements:

- Python 3.14

Create an isolated environment and run the development server:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=src
export SOCIAL_ENV=development
export SOCIAL_SECRET_KEY='development-only-change-me'
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Development endpoints

- `GET /livez/` — process liveness.
- `GET /readyz/` — database-aware readiness.
- `GET /api/v1/status/` — bounded product, lifecycle, version, capability, and integration-status information.

No content-creation, account-authentication, profile-collection, space-invitation/join-request/rule, bookmark/poll/reply, restrict/report/space-ban/moderation-case/action/appeal mutation, or personalized-feed API is exposed by this milestone. That boundary is intentional until GoreeCloud Identity authorization, Privacy Shield policy, Wardveil Security controls, API contracts, and abuse protections are defined and accepted for those operations.

## Validation

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
export SOCIAL_ENV=test
export SOCIAL_SECRET_KEY='test-only-key'
python scripts/validate_repository.py
python -m compileall -q manage.py src tests scripts
python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
python manage.py migrate --noinput
python manage.py check
python manage.py test tests -v 2
```

Passing source CI does not establish production deployment, platform-system acceptance, privacy acceptance, security acceptance, recovery acceptance, or Stable qualification.

## Platform Contract

This repository carries a schema-version `0.4` `goreecloud.platform.yaml` declaration with exactly nine Integral Platform Systems. It records the application as Development and nonconformant while required Integral Platform System integrations and acceptance evidence remain incomplete.
